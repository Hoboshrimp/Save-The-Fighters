# MMA State Athletic Commissions Contact List

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive CSV file listing contact information for athletic commissions across all 50 U.S. states, specifically focused on those overseeing Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and combat sports. The data includes state names, commission names, and email addresses where available, compiled from public sources like the Association of Boxing Commissions and state websites.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to empower MMA fans, fighters, and advocates by providing an accessible and centralized resource to contact state athletic commissions. By facilitating direct communication, this contact list enables the community to:
- **Voice Concerns**: Reach out to commissions to address issues like poor officiating, inconsistent regulations, or safety concerns in MMA events.
- **Protect Fighters**: Advocate for fair treatment, improved safety protocols, and accountability in officiating to safeguard athletes.
- **Promote Transparency**: Encourage open dialogue with regulatory bodies to ensure the integrity of combat sports.
